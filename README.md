# 🤖 GenAI Portfolio 

This repository showcases a collection of **beginner-friendly GenAI mini-projects** created to build foundational skills in data annotation, model feedback, and text classification.  
Each project is designed to help students gain practical, hands-on experience in **AI data preparation** and **human feedback workflows** — essential steps in the GenAI development pipeline.

## 🪶 1. 🖼️ Image Annotation Project
**Task:** Annotated images with multiple object labels using bounding boxes and polygons.  
**Samples:** ~100+ manually annotated images  
**Tools Used:** Label Studio, Python, Google Colab, GitHub  
**Skills Practiced:**  
- Object detection and segmentation  
- Data labeling using COCO JSON format  
- Using Label Studio for AI data preparation  
- Organizing datasets for ML pipelines

## 🧾 2. 🗂️ Text Classification Project
**Task:** Classified 200 text samples (movie reviews/tweets) into Positive / Negative sentiment categories.  
**Samples:** 200  
**Tools Used:** Google Colab, Python (Pandas), Kaggle (IMDb dataset)  
**Skills Practiced:**  
- Text preprocessing and labeling  
- Sentiment analysis fundamentals  
- Working with CSV datasets  
- Preparing data for NLP model training  

📄 *File:* [`text-classification-sample.csv`](./text-classification-sample.csv)

## 💬 3. 🧠 RLHF (Response Ranking) Project
**Task:** Collected AI-generated responses for 20 prompts and ranked them based on helpfulness and clarity.  
**Samples:** 20 prompts × 2 responses each  
**Tools Used:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Hugging Face, Google Colab  
**Skills Practiced:**  
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) basics  
- Evaluating and ranking AI-generated text  
- Understanding preference-based training data  
- Structuring datasets for alignment research
